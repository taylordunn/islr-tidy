# Who, what, and why? {-}

I am a data scientist and statistician who is (mostly) self-taught from textbooks and generous people sharing their work online.
Inspired by projects like [Solomon Kurz's recoding of Statistical Rethinking](https://bookdown.org/content/3890/), I decided to publicly document my notes and code as I work through [An Introduction to Statistical Learning, 2nd edition](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani [@James2021].

I prefer to work with the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages, and will be teaching myself the [`tidymodels` framework](https://www.tidymodels.org/) for machine learning along the way.

I won't be doing every exercise or section. My main goal for this project is to improve my statistical programming, so I will focus on the applied exercises rather than the conceptual.
