## An Introduction to Statistical Learning  with Applications in R

My notes and code as I work through ISLR 2nd edition by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.
Where possible, I use the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` collection of packages.

The book is hosted online here: https://bookdown.org/taylordunn/islr-tidy-1655226885741/.
